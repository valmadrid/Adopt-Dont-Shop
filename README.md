# Helping Rehome Our Pets
*Petfinder.my is a Malaysian website that hosts pet listings for adoption and for sale.  It also educates the public on how to manage their pets responsibly.  It is also used as a venue for animal welfare advocates.

### Introduction
This project aims to help shelters, rescuers and owners rehome their pets faster.  A classifier model was developed to predict the adoption rate.  As for Petfinder.my, some enhancements were recommended to help boost the adoptability of the pets.  As a supplement, a recommendation system was also created based on images.
